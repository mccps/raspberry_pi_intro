##Design Thinking
When developing any projects it is helpful to consider what you are trying to create and how you will create it. Design thinking is a process where we discover what to create and use creative problem solving to bring that project to life. You can use the DEEP Design Thinking process to help support this process.

#DEEP - Discover, Empathize, Experiment, Produce
Discover: Seek out opportunities for Design
Empathize: Understand the who and
Experiment: Create a prototype to learn how your project works (and how it doesn't)
Produce: Get feedback, share your project, and reflect on next steps
